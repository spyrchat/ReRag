    "content": "Title: Binding a WPF ComboBox to a custom list\n\nQuestion: Binding a WPF ComboBox to a custom list I have a ComboBox that doesn't seem to update the SelectedItem/SelectedValue. The ComboBox ItemsSource is bound to a property on a ViewModel class that lists a bunch of RAS phonebook entries as a CollectionView. Then I've bound (at separate times) both the <code>SelectedItem</code> or <code>SelectedValue</code> to another property of the ViewModel. I have added a MessageBox into the save command to debug the values set by the databinding, but the <code>SelectedItem</code>/<code>SelectedValue</code> binding is not being set. The ViewModel class looks something like this: The _phonebookEntries collection is being initialised in the constructor from a business object. The ComboBox XAML looks something like this: I am only interested in the actual string value displayed in the ComboBox, not any other properties of the object as this is the value I need to pass across to RAS when I want to make the VPN connection, hence <code>DisplayMemberPath</code> and <code>SelectedValuePath</code> are both the Name property of the ConnectionViewModel. The ComboBox is in a <code>DataTemplate</code> applied to an <code>ItemsControl</code> on a Window who's DataContext  has been set to a ViewModel instance. The ComboBox displays the list of items correctly, and I can select one in the UI with no problem. However when I display the message box from the command, the PhonebookEntry property still has the initial value in it, not the selected value from the ComboBox. Other TextBox instances are updating fine and displaying in the MessageBox. What am I missing with databinding the ComboBox? I've done a lot of searching and can't seem to find anything that I'm doing wrong. This is the behaviour I'm seeing, however it's not working for some reason in my particular context. I have a MainWindowViewModel which has a <code>CollectionView</code> of ConnectionViewModels. In the MainWindowView.xaml file code-behind, I set the DataContext to the MainWindowViewModel. The MainWindowView.xaml has an <code>ItemsControl</code> bound to the collection of ConnectionViewModels. I have a DataTemplate that holds the ComboBox as well as some other TextBoxes. The TextBoxes are bound directly to properties of the ConnectionViewModel using <code>Text=\"{Binding Path=ConnectionName}\"</code>. The XAML code-behind: Then XAML: The TextBoxes all bind correctly, and data moves between them and the ViewModel with no trouble. It's only the ComboBox that isn't working. You are correct in your assumption regarding the PhonebookEntry class. The assumption I am making is that the DataContext used by my DataTemplate is automatically set through the binding hierarchy, so that I don't have to explicitly set it for each item in the <code>ItemsControl</code>. That would seem a bit silly to me. Here is a test implementation that demonstrates the problem, based on the example above. XAML: The code-behind: If you run that example, you will get the behaviour I'm talking about. The TextBox updates its binding fine when you edit it, but the ComboBox does not. Very confusing seeing as really the only thing I've done is introduce a parent ViewModel. I am currently labouring under the impression that an item bound to the child of a DataContext has that child as its DataContext. I can't find any documentation that clears this up one way or the other. I.e., Window -> DataContext = MainWindowViewModel ..Items -> Bound to DataContext.PhonebookEntries ....Item -> DataContext = PhonebookEntry (implicitly associated) I don't know if that explains my assumption any better(? ). To confirm my assumption, change the binding of the TextBox to be And this will show the TextBox binding root (which I'm comparing to the DataContext) is the ConnectionViewModel instance.",

I am pretty sure though that that means the webserver is running the rest of the page I redirected away from. Which would seem to be inefficient to say the least. Is there a better way to do this?
